# Shaping Function

Shaping functions are simple and a good start to learning shaders, so this is a series of them 
for practice and good examples to all who want to get involved and see some code that is simple
in its nature and in its math

| ![](Previews/stepFunc.png =200x) | ![](Previews/Linear.png =200x) |

Goal was to practice and understand shaders more
